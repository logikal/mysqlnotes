MySQLNotes
========================

This is my attempt at creating an eggdrop script that uses MySQL as the backend for its notes, instead of a flat file of doom. 

Use at your own risk..



How to use this
========================

Quite simple:
* Grab the files, put them somewhere your eggdrop can source them.
* edit dbconfig.tcl for your database.
* source the mysqlnotes.tcl in your eggdrop.conf

Voila.
